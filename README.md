# Questions 

1. If a configuration is given can you tell if it is balanced or not?
2. Given an n and k, can you tell how many balanced configurations we can get? (If we can drop this down to a formula then the next question calculation will be easier)
3. Chart of n vs k, where red denotes balanced 
4. What is the probability distribution of balanced configurations vs n (the plot of balanced configuration % vs n)
